# DecisionTree-Classification_reaserch

This repository contains files for a project employing feature extraction method called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a parameter setting of n_components=25, and SelectKBest feature selection technique using the F-classification (f-classif) scoring function with k=10 as the number of selected features. For classification purposes, this project assess the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier.

In this project, I experimented with different configurations of the Decision Tree Classifier, varying the maximum depth parameter with values of 5, 10, and 20. Additionally, I tested the classifier with and without specifying the maximum number of features to consider at each split, setting max_features="sqrt".

These experiments were conducted using the CoverType dataset.
